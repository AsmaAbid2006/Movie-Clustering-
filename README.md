# Movie-Clustering-
This is a detailed and explained code which trains a machine learning model for making movie clusters on basis of user ratings and genres
This project can me used in cinemas for recommending movies to a user based on their interest.
It required a movie dataset which I have downoaded from kaggle. There are some .csv files for the movie dataset which are attatched in the repositories. 
All you need to do is give the path to the .csv files in the code where needed.
Every step in the code is well explaind in the form of comments.
